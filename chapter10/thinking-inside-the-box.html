    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>The <i>cottage gardan</i> is a distindt style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href="">england</a> and its history can be tracded back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a href="">English estate gardens</a>.</p>
    <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than thier modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
